Architecture design patterns are sets of names (labels) and problem description pairs.   Please generate a list of common architecture patterns used in the field of Generative AI.  

Return the result in pure raw markdown format with header level 4 (####) for the pattern name and standard markdown content for the description.

For each pattern list related patterns.

#### Autoencoder-Based Generative Model

Autoencoders are a specific type of neural network architecture used for unsupervised learning. The primary objective is to encode the input data as internal fixed-size representations in reduced dimensionality and then to reconstruct the output from this representation.

**Related Patterns**
- Variational Autoencoders
- Sparse Autoencoders
- Denoising Autoencoders

#### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

VAEs are a type of probabilistic generative model that are based on the Autoencoder architecture. They are used to generate new data that's similar to the training data, but VAEs are designed to be probabilistic, meaning that they provide a distribution over possible outputs.

**Related Patterns**
- Autoencoders
- Conditional VAEs
- Beta-VAEs

#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of two neural networks, namely the Generator and the Discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through a sort of contest. The Generator tries to produce fake data, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish fake from real data.

**Related Patterns**
- Conditional GANs
- Wasserstein GANs
- CycleGANs

#### Conditional GANs (cGANs)

This architecture is an extension of the standard GAN, where both the generator and the discriminator are conditioned on some extra information (e.g., labels), thus enabling targeted data generation.

**Related Patterns**
- GANs
- InfoGANs
- Pix2Pix

#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Generation

In this pattern, RNNs are used for generating sequences of data. This is particularly useful for text, time-series, and music generation.

**Related Patterns**
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
- Sequence to Sequence Models

#### Transformer-Based Generative Models

Transformers are particularly effective in handling sequences and have shown state-of-the-art performance in tasks like text, image, and even music generation.

**Related Patterns**
- GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)
- BERT for Generation (though primarily a discriminative model)
- Sequence to Sequence Models with Transformer architecture

#### Style Transfer Networks

These networks are used to apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another image. This is done without altering the content but changing the style, thereby generating a new image that's a sort of 'fusion' of the two.

**Related Patterns**
- CycleGANs
- Neural Style Transfer
- Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN)

#### Flow-Based Generative Models

These models provide an exact likelihood and tractable sampling by transforming a simple distribution into a complex one. They are often used in cases where exact likelihoods are necessary.

**Related Patterns**
- Normalizing Flows
- RealNVP
- Glow

#### Energy-Based Generative Models

These models define a scalar energy function to assign a value to each possible configuration of the input variables and aim to learn the parameters of these energy functions for generating data.

**Related Patterns**
- Boltzmann Machines
- Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
- Hopfield Networks
