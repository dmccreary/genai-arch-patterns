# Fine-Tuned Model Pattern

A specialization pattern where a pre-trained Large Language Model is further trained on domain-specific data to improve performance for particular tasks or domains. This pattern creates specialized models that understand domain-specific terminology, follow specific formats, or exhibit particular behaviors.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when you need models to understand specialized domain knowledge, follow specific output formats consistently, or when RAG doesn't provide sufficient performance improvements. Ideal for highly specialized domains like legal, medical, or technical fields where domain expertise is critical and consistent behavior is required.

## Architecture Drawing

The architecture illustrates the fine-tuning pipeline from data preparation through model training to deployment, with ongoing monitoring and evaluation components.
