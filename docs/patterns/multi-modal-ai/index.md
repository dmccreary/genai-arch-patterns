# Multi-Modal AI Pattern

An integration pattern that combines multiple types of AI models to process different data modalities (text, images, audio, video) within a single application. This pattern enables more comprehensive understanding and generation across various media types.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when applications need to understand or generate content across multiple media types, when context spans different modalities, or when you need to provide rich, multimedia responses. Essential for content creation platforms, educational systems, and comprehensive document analysis applications.

## Architecture Drawing

The architecture demonstrates multiple specialized models for different modalities coordinated through a central fusion engine that combines insights and generates multi-modal responses.

**Components:**
- User Interface (300, 50)
- Modality Router (300, 100)
- Text Processing Engine (150, 200)
- Image Processing Engine (300, 200)
- Audio Processing Engine (450, 200)
- Multi-Modal Fusion Engine (300, 300)
- Response Generator (300, 400)
- Vector Store (500, 250)
- Context Manager (100, 300)
