# Prompt Engineering and Template Management Pattern

A governance pattern that centralizes prompt design, versioning, and optimization across an organization. This pattern ensures consistency, enables prompt reuse, and provides systematic approaches to prompt improvement and testing.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when multiple teams are using similar prompts, when you need consistent prompt quality across applications, or when prompt performance optimization is critical. Essential for large organizations with multiple AI applications and when prompt intellectual property needs protection.

## Architecture Drawing

The architecture shows a centralized prompt management system that stores, versions, and optimizes prompts, with testing capabilities and integration points for various applications.

**Components:**
- Prompt Repository (300, 50)
- Prompt Designer Interface (150, 120)
- Version Control System (300, 120)
- Template Engine (450, 120)
- A/B Testing Framework (300, 200)
- Performance Analyzer (450, 200)
- Application Integration (150, 280)
- LLM Services (300, 280)
- Metrics Dashboard (450, 280)

**Edges:**
- Prompt Designer Interface → Prompt Repository: "New Prompts"
