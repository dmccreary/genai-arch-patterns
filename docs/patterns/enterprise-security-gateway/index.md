# Enterprise Security Gateway Pattern

A security-focused pattern that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and monitoring for all AI service interactions within an enterprise. This pattern ensures compliance, audit trails, and proper access controls across all generative AI applications.

## When to Use

Use this pattern in enterprise environments with strict security requirements, regulatory compliance needs, or when multiple AI services need consistent security policies. Essential for financial services, healthcare, government, and other highly regulated industries.

## Architecture Drawing

The architecture shows all AI service requests flowing through a centralized security gateway that handles authentication, authorization, logging, and compliance before routing to appropriate AI services.

**Components:**
- User Applications (200, 50)
- API Gateway (200, 150)
- Security Gateway (400, 150)
- Authentication Service (300, 200)
- Authorization Service (500, 200)
- Audit Logger (400, 250)
- Compliance Monitor (550, 250)
- LLM Services (200, 300)
- Vector Stores (400, 300)
- Agent Services (600, 300)

**Edges:**
- User Applications → API Gateway: "AI Service Request"
- API Gateway → Security Gateway: "Authenticated Request"
- Security Gateway → Authentication Service: "Identity Verification"
- Security Gateway → Authorization Service: "Permission Check"
- Security Gateway → LLM Services: "Authorized Request"
- Security Gateway → Vector Stores: "Authorized Query"
- Security Gateway → Agent Services: "Authorized Task"
- Security Gateway → Audit Logger: "Request Log"
- Audit Logger → Compliance Monitor: "Audit Trail"
- Compliance Monitor → Security Gateway: "Policy Updates"
