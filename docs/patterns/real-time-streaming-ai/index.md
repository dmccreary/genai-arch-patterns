# Real-Time Streaming AI Pattern

A data processing pattern that applies AI models to continuous data streams in real-time, enabling immediate responses and continuous learning from streaming data sources. This pattern supports low-latency AI applications that need to process data as it arrives.

## When to Use

Use this pattern for applications requiring immediate AI responses to streaming data, real-time decision making, or continuous model adaptation. Essential for fraud detection, real-time personalization, IoT analytics, and live content moderation systems.

## Architecture Drawing

The architecture depicts streaming data flowing through real-time processing engines with AI models that can make immediate decisions and optionally trigger actions or updates.

**Components:**
- Data Sources (100, 50)
- Stream Ingestion (200, 50)
- Event Router (300, 50)
- Stream Processor A (200, 150)
- Stream Processor B (400, 150)
- AI Model Service (300, 200)
- Decision Engine (450, 200)
- Action Triggers (550, 200)
- State Store (200, 250)
- Monitoring Dashboard (450, 250)

**Edges:**
- Data Sources → Stream Ingestion: "Raw Data Stream"
- Stream Ingestion → Event Router: "Processed Events"
- Event Router → Stream Processor A: "Event Stream A"
- Event Router → Stream Processor B: "Event Stream B"
- Stream Processor A → AI Model Service: "Feature Extraction"
- Stream Processor B → AI Model Service: "Feature Extraction"
- AI Model Service → Decision Engine: "AI Predictions"
- Decision Engine → Action Triggers: "Automated Actions"
- Stream Processor A → State Store: "State Updates"
- AI Model Service → Monitoring Dashboard: "Performance Metrics"
