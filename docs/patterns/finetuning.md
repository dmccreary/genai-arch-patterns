# Finetuning

Finetuning is the process of adding an additional layer of processing to the output of a large-language model to generate specific outcomes.

Finetuning is an alternative to [prompt enrichment](prompt-enrichment.md).  The downside to finetuning is that each fine-tuned model must be hosted in a separate instance causing the cost of deployment to go up.
