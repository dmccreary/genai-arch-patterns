# How We Built This Site

This website was created using mostly open-source tools.  We would like to acknowledge the work the developers did to contribute these tools to the community.

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/dmccreary/genai-arch-patterns) - we use GitHub Pages to host this site and we use GitHub issues for tracking additions and change requests.
2. [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - all the content in this site uses this format.  Markdown is now the defacto
format for GitHub documentation and for documenting code including the content within our Jupyter Notebooks.
3. [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) Conda is Python Virtual Environment that allows us to keep our Python libraries in sync for each of our development projects.  See our README.md file for specific site build instructions.
4. [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) - a Python tool for converting Markdown into HTML.  Mkdocs allows us to test the web site on our
local systems before we commit our changes to the central GitHub
repository.
5. [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) - We love the material UI look and feel as well as all the additions they
have provided.
6. [Admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/) - We use the Material Admonitions addon to display notes and warnings
7. Visual Studio Code - Integrated Development Environment that has strong
code completion for Markdown and mkdocs and 
8. [Grammarly VSCode Plugin]([grammarly.com](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=znck.grammarly)) - Grammer checking, spell checking etc.
9.  [Google Analytics](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-site-analytics/) - we use the Mkdocs Material add on to add Google Analytics to all our pages.  This allows us to track what pages people are viewing the most and how long they stay on our site.
10.  [ChatGPT 4](https://chat.openai.com/) - We use ChatGPT for brainstorming, list generation, diagram generation and other tasks.
11.  [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - We use Processing version five in JavaScript to generate diagrams and simulations
