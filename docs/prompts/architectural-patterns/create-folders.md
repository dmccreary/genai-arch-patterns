# Create Folder

!!! prompt
    Please look at the file /docs/patterns/list-of-patterns.md.  This file contains a list of patterns in level-2 markdown headers.  Please create 
  one folder in the /docs/patterns folder for each pattern.  The folder name should be lowercase only letters with dashes.  Within each folder 
  create a index.md file and copy the contents of the level-2 content into that index.md file.  Make the title level 1 header the name of the 
  pattern.
