# Top 10 Generative AI Architecture Patterns for Large Enterprises

## 1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pattern

A foundational pattern that enhances Large Language Models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases before generating responses. This pattern combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with the accuracy and freshness of retrieved documents, reducing hallucinations and providing source attribution.
