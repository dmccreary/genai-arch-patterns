for each folder, create a JSON file with the drawing information in it.  The JSON file should have the same name as the pattern.  The JSON file 
  should use the format for the vis-network.js software which has a list of nodes with an ID, the x,y position and a list of edges.  Make sure to 
  put the title in the JSON file.
