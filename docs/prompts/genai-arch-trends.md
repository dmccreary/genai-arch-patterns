Here’s a concise, research-driven view of how enterprise architects (EAs) are using generative AI as a force multiplier.

### Top 10 trends EAs are leaning into

1. **Agentic AI moves from pilots to platform features.** EAs are planning for multi-agent patterns, persistent memory, and agent-to-agent standards as vendors roadmap “agentic” capabilities into mainstream software. ([Gartner][1])
2. **“Continuous EA”: living, real-time architecture models.** AI augments EA with telemetry-fed, machine-readable models and copilots that advise, validate, and even act—shifting EA from episodic reviews to continuous governance. ([Forrester][2])
3. **AI-augmented EA tooling becomes standard.** Leading EAMS vendors embed GenAI for inventory building, modeling, documentation, reasoning (e.g., MCP gateways), and governance—multiplying EA throughput. ([leanix.net][3])
4. **Enterprise-wide AI governance anchored in EA.** EAs stand up policies, controls, catalogs, and lineage to de-risk AI at scale; dedicated EA-led AI management solutions are emerging. ([ardoq.com][4])
5. **Data fabric & knowledge layers as AI context backbones.** To curb hallucinations and enable agent orchestration, EAs prioritize unified, governed data fabrics/knowledge graphs over fragmented data silos. ([TechRadar][5])
6. **Open, modular AI reference architectures.** EAs design reusable services with APIs plus “policy-as-code” and “infra-as-code” to swap models/providers and scale reuse across domains. ([McKinsey & Company][6])
7. **Core modernization with an “intelligent core.”** GenAI is woven into ERP/core systems and modernization programs, with EA steering where AI augments processes vs. replaces them. ([Deloitte][7])
8. **Value-linked roadmaps & portfolio rationalization.** EA uses GenAI to accelerate capability mapping, scenario design, and tech-debt reduction—tying AI initiatives to measurable business outcomes. ([Gartner][8])
9. **Pragmatism on impact metrics.** After early hype, EAs emphasize integration with workflows and measurable P\&L impact; most value comes when AI is applied to specific, automatable back-office work. ([Tom's Hardware][9])
10. **Skills & methods refresh within EA frameworks.** TOGAF-aligned guidance and skills updates reflect AI-era roles (governance, building-block selection, sustainability)—raising EA’s strategic profile. ([blog.opengroup.org][10])
