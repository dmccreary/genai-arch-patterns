# Key Features for AI-Generated Architecture Diagrams

We want to use an LLM to generate our AI drawings in a *declarative* way.  
By declarative, we want the drawing to specify *what* should be drawn, how the elements are connected
but not focus on the details of drawing the diagrams such as pixel-by-pixel placement or what
colors and font types to use.  These parameters should be part of the overall site design
specification.

We want to store the drawings in a JSON format that is independent of a specific drawing tool.

## JSON-Based Diagram Representation

**Structured Data Format**
JSON provides a machine-readable format that AI can easily generate, modify, and version. The schema should include nodes (architectural components), edges (relationships), layout information, and metadata for interactive features.

**Standardized Schema Design**
Develop a consistent JSON schema that captures:
- Node properties (type, position, styling, metadata)
- Edge definitions (source, target, relationship type, styling)
- Layout configurations (clustering rules, positioning constraints)
- Interactive elements (hover content, click actions, documentation links)
- Versioning metadata (creation date, AI model used, validation status)

**AI Generation Compatibility**
Structure the JSON format to align with how large language models naturally represent architectural concepts, making it easier for AI to generate syntactically correct and semantically meaningful diagrams.

## Visual Diff Capabilities for JSON Files

**Semantic Change Detection**
Beyond standard text-based diffs, implement visual diff tools that understand architectural semantics - detecting when services are added/removed, relationships change, or component types are modified.

**Side-by-Side Diagram Comparison**
Render two versions of architecture diagrams simultaneously, highlighting differences through color coding, annotations, and change indicators directly on the visual elements.

**Change Impact Analysis**
AI-powered analysis of JSON diffs to identify cascading effects of architectural changes, such as when a database modification impacts multiple dependent services.

**Version History Visualization**
Timeline-based interface showing how architecture has evolved over time, with the ability to compare any two versions and understand the rationale behind changes.

## Smart Clustering Capabilities

**Automatic Grouping Logic**
AI algorithms that analyze node relationships, data flow patterns, and functional domains to automatically cluster related components into logical groupings.

**Hierarchical Organization**
Multi-level clustering that can represent architecture at different abstraction levels - from high-level business domains down to individual microservices and their dependencies.

**Dynamic Reclustering**
Ability to reorganize clusters based on different criteria (technology stack, team ownership, security zones, deployment environments) without losing the underlying architectural relationships.

**Cluster Metadata Management**
Rich information about each cluster including ownership, SLA requirements, security boundaries, and compliance considerations that can be leveraged for automated documentation and governance.

## Extended Interactivity Features

**Multi-Layer Information Architecture**
Hover interactions that reveal progressively detailed information - from basic component descriptions to detailed technical specifications, performance metrics, and operational status.

**Contextual Documentation Links**
Smart linking that connects diagram elements to relevant sections of technical documentation, runbooks, API specifications, and architectural decision records (ADRs).

**Interactive Filtering and Exploration**
Dynamic filtering capabilities that allow users to focus on specific technology stacks, teams, environments, or architectural concerns while maintaining context of the broader system.

**Guided Navigation Workflows**
AI-generated pathways through complex architectures that guide users through common exploration patterns like data flow analysis, security review, or impact assessment.

## Comprehensive Node Type Library

**Infrastructure Components**
Extensive library of database nodes (relational, NoSQL, graph, time-series), messaging systems (queues, event streams, pub/sub), and storage solutions (object stores, file systems, CDNs).

**Application Architecture Elements**
Microservice nodes, API gateways, load balancers, caching layers, and authentication services with appropriate visual styling and metadata schemas.

**Network and Security Boundaries**
Specialized nodes for firewalls, VPNs, security zones, network segments, and compliance boundaries that can be used to overlay security architecture onto application diagrams.

**Monitoring and Observability**
Status indicator nodes that can display real-time health metrics, alert states, and performance indicators, with the ability to drill down into detailed monitoring dashboards.

**Integration Pattern Nodes**
Visual representations of common integration patterns like circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, saga patterns, and event sourcing components.

## Additional Critical Features

**Template and Pattern Libraries**
Pre-built architectural patterns (microservices, event-driven, layered architecture) that AI can use as starting points and customize based on specific requirements.

**Validation and Consistency Checking**
AI-powered validation that ensures architectural diagrams follow organizational standards, detect potential anti-patterns, and verify that all required documentation links are present and valid.

**Export and Integration Capabilities**
Support for exporting diagrams in multiple formats (SVG, PNG, PDF) while preserving interactive elements where possible, and integration with popular documentation platforms and architectural tools.

**Collaborative Annotation System**
Features for multiple stakeholders to add comments, suggestions, and approvals directly to diagram elements, with workflow support for architectural review processes.

**Automated Synchronization**
Capability to automatically update diagrams based on changes detected in source code repositories, infrastructure as code definitions, or service discovery systems.

These features create a comprehensive platform that leverages AI to transform how enterprise architects create, maintain, and interact with architectural documentation, making it both more accurate and more useful for stakeholders across the organization.
