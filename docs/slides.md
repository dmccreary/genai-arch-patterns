## MACC 2023

**Title:** Architecture Patterns for Generative AI

**Description:**
Generative AI is by far the most impactful technology in the last ten years.  It dominates the priority list of almost every CIO in the world.  This session will review key architectural patterns that organizations are using to safely harness the power of Generative AI to build intelligent search, chatbots, and agents and perform various tasks on unstructured text.  We will cover the emerging key use case taxonomies and the architectural patterns we need to support these initiatives.  If implemented, these patterns can accelerate the process of building intelligent agents for all knowledge workers.
