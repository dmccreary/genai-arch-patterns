## Cosine Similarity

A measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors.

Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between the vectors; that is, it is the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths.

Calculation of the cosine similarity between a given vector and a set of possibly billions of vectors can be a time-consuming problem that is easily accelerated by FPGA hardware.
